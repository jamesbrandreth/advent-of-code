# ðŸŽ„Advent of Code (2021)

Welcome to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Getting started

Commit your solution attempts following this structure: `<day>/<language>_<github-username>`

**You have free reign** over the code structure inside your folders, but if everything goes to plan
we'll end up with a loose structure like so:

```
day-01/
  python_jamesbrandreth/
    part_one.rkt
    part_two.rkt
day-02/
  ...
```

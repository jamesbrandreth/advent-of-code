# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Getting started

Commit your solution attempts following this structure: `<year>/<github_username>/<day>_<language>`

**You have free reign** over the code structure inside your folders, but if everything goes to plan
we'll end up with a loose structure like so:

```
2021/
  jamesbrandreth/
    day-01/
      part_one.rkt
      part_two.rkt
2022/
  ...
```
